## 🚀 **Core Architecture**

### **The Brain: Proxy Server**
The core of Bandit is a FastAPI-based proxy server (`proxy_server.py`) that orchestrates all intelligence.

| Mode | Model | Latency | Use Case |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| ⚡ **Instant** | `gemini-3-flash-preview` | < 3s | Quick chat, simple queries |
| ⚖️ **Auto** | Hybrid Routing | Variable | Balanced complexity |
| 🧠 **Thinking** | `gemini-3-pro-preview` | Deep | Complex reasoning, coding, strategy |

### **Intelligence & Memory**
*   **🏗️ Reasoning Engine**: Google Vertex AI Reasoning Engine (ID: `3723065118905335808`)
*   **📚 RAG (Knowledge)**: Enterprise-grade **Vertex AI Search** (Data Store: `bandit-hq-knowledge`). Grounded in 55+ HQ documents.
*   **💾 Memory**: Persistent contexts and world model stored in `HQ/`.
*   **🛠️ Tools**:
    *   🌐 **Google Search**: Real-time web grounding.
    *   💻 **Code Execution**: Python sandbox for math and logic.
    *   🔬 **Deep Research**: Asynchronous deep dive capabilities.
    *   🏠 **IoT Control**: LIFX & Music integration.

## 💼 **Business Context: LMSIFY**

**Let Me Say It For You LLC (LMSIFY)** is the parent entity, an experiential wellness practice led by **Marquitah Snowball ("Snow")**.

*   **✨ Mission**: Consent-centered somatic sessions that blend sensation, mindfulness, and embodiment.
*   **🔮 Key Offerings**:
    *   **The Celestial Experience**: Luxuriously paced somatic sensation sessions.
    *   **SnowDayKokoa**: The service and events brand.
    *   **PAUSE Portal**: Educational workshops and small-group experiences.

> **Bandit's Role**: Operational architecture, copy generation, and strategic planning for the LMSIFY ecosystem.

### **🔮 Amplifying the Brand**
Bandit leverages specialized knowledge files to enhance LMSIFY's distinct brand voice and operations:

*   **🗣️ Platform-Safe Sorcery**: Using the `lmsify_platform_language` protocol, Bandit generates "soft-coded" social captions (e.g., using *"Exchange of breath"* instead of explicit terms) to bypass censorship while maintaining the **mystical/seductive** vibe.
*   **🏭 Mogul Operations**: Bandit optimizes the **Design Shop** (`lmsify_design_shop_tools`) by tracking production inventory (e.g., Grommet Press specs for merch) and calculating ROI on equipment investments like sound loops and lighting.
*   **🧘 High-Fidelity Embodiment**: The Reasoning Engine structures "Celestial Experience" flows, ensuring every somatic session is paced for maximum nervous system regulation and pleasure literacy.
*   **📅 Mogul Operations Flow**: A Notion-first automation system (`lmsify_business_automations`) handles the full client lifecycle: **Lead → Client → Session → Follow-up → Revenue**. Includes Google Calendar sync, aftercare emails, quarterly tax reminders, and VIP re-engagement.
*   **🔗 Notion API Integration**: Full SDK integration with `notion-client` for automated session tracking, client management, and aftercare email dispatch.

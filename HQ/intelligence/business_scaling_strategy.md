## LLC Structure for Acquisition

- Single EIN
- Applies for SBA loans

### 2. Divisions as DBAs
- SnowDayKokoa (DBA)

- P.A.U.S.E. (DBA)

### 3. Subsidiary LLCs for Acquisitions
When buying a business:

- Protects parent brand from risk
- Clean bookkeeping for SBA

### Requirements for SBA Readiness
- Clean financials
- LLC properly filed
- Business bank account (separate)

## SBA 7(a) Loan Strategy

### What It Is
- Government-backed business loan
- 10% down payment
- 10-25 year repayment
- Low interest rates
- Can buy entire businesses, equipment, real estate

### The Play
1. Find profitable business (e.g., laundromat making $200K/year)
2. Get SBA loan for 90% of cost
3. Pay 10% down
4. Business cash flow pays the loan
5. Profit from excess
6. Own asset you barely paid for upfront

## Notion Organization Tips

### Four Core Databases

3. **Financials** — Revenue, expenses, goals, event logs
4. **Products & Services** — Sessions, portals, kits, merch

### Structure Rules
- Use databases, not random pages
- Create views (Calendar, Board, Table, Gallery)
- Use templates inside each database
- Use toggles to hide long sections
- Pin only 2 pages in sidebar
- Build only what you're actively moving

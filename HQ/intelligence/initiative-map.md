| Command Deck Visualization | Build dashboard surfaces for admin/logs + portals data | Core + UIUX Agents | feature/hq-command-deck | Planned | Wireframe views + data sources |
| Ritual Reminder Automation | Script reminders tied to `notes/project.log` timestamps | Bandit + Core | scripts/ritual-reminders.ts | Backlog | Define cron + CLI output |
| Portal Intake Revamp | Standardize directive intake with compliance gating | Compliance + Content | docs/intake-spec.md | Backlog | Draft template + gating questions |

## How to Use
1. Update this table whenever an initiative advances; keep statuses aligned with Git branch states.
2. Reference supporting materials (design files, PRs, transcripts) in the Branch/Doc column.
3. During Pulse Review, read the table out loud and collect deltas.
4. Archive completed initiatives at the bottom with final notes + outcomes.

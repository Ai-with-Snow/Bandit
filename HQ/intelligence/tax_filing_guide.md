## Filing Before LLC

### Key Steps
1. **Catch up on personal taxes** — Start with most recent year, work backwards
2. **Document pre-LLC income** — Any work counts as sole proprietorship income
3. **Report all income** — CashApp, Venmo, Zelle, 1099s, tips
4. **Track expenses** — Bank statements count as proof
5. **Clear status before LLC** — File 2024 before forming LLC in 2025

## W-9 and 1099 Rules

### W-9 Process
1. Client sends W-9 request to you
2. You fill out: name, SSN/EIN, address
3. Client keeps on file for 1099 generation

### 1099-NEC Process
1. Business pays you $600+ in a year
2. They collect your W-9
3. By Jan 31: they file 1099-NEC with IRS + send you copy
4. You report income on Schedule C

### If No 1099 Received
- **Still report the income** as "Other self-employed income"
- Use bank statements, CashApp history as proof
- Your compliance matters more than their paperwork

## Home Office Deduction

### Qualification
- Must be used **exclusively and regularly** for work
- Dedicated space (not also bedroom/living room)

### Methods

**Simplified Method:**
- $5 per sq ft (up to 300 sq ft)
- Max $1,500 deduction
- Easy, no tracking needed

**Actual Expense Method:**
- Calculate % of home used for business
- Apply % to rent, utilities, Wi-Fi, insurance
- Much larger deduction for high rent

### Example Calculation (NYC $2,300/month rent)
- Home: 600 sq ft
- Office: 108 sq ft (18%)
- Rent: $2,300 × 10 months = $23,000
- Deduction: $23,000 × 18% = **$4,140**

### Carryover
If expenses > income, unused deduction carries forward to future years

---

## Deduction Categories

### Core Expenses
- **Home office** — Rent %, utilities, Wi-Fi
- **Advertising** — Website, business cards, social media
- **Communications** — Phone (50-70% business use), internet
- **Supplies** — Candles, incense, journals, Cricut materials
- **Travel** — Uber, Lyft, gas, parking for gigs
- **Meals** — 50% deductible during client meetings

### Safe Percentages
- **Wi-Fi:** 50-70% business use
- **Phone:** 50-70% business use
- **Home office:** 10-20% of home (average)

## Public Assistance + Taxes Strategy

### Key Points
- SNAP, Section 8, Medicaid are **NOT taxable income**
- Assistance programs may review your tax return
- **Lower net income = helps preserve eligibility**
- Deductions reduce taxable income (good for both IRS and benefits)

### Strategy
1. Report all income honestly
2. Maximize deductions to lower net profit
3. Shows IRS you're legit business
4. Shows assistance programs low net income
5. Bank carryover deductions for when income scales

---

## 2025 Planning

### When LLC is Active
- Business income flows through Schedule C (single-member LLC)
- Switch W-9 to show LLC name + EIN
- Keep personal and business credit separate
- Use carryover deductions from 2024

### Quarterly Estimated Taxes
- Self-employed pay quarterly (April, June, Sept, Jan)
- Avoid penalties by paying ahead
- Rule of thumb: Save 25-30% of profit for taxes

---

## Record Keeping

### What to Save
- Bank statements
- CashApp/Venmo/Zelle history
- Invoices and receipts
- Screenshots of payments
- Utility bills
- Lease agreement

### How Long
- Keep records for **3-7 years** (IRS can audit)

4. **Territory** — Where they can sell (U.S. only, worldwide)
5. **Duration** — Usually 6-12 months, renewable
6. **Approval Rights** — You approve final designs before production
7. **Termination** — License ends if they breach terms

### License Clause Template
> LMSIFY grants [Partner] a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the designs only on agreed candle products, for the term of the contract. All intellectual property remains sole property of LMSIFY.

## Licensing vs. Filing

| Action | What It Does |
|--------|--------------|
| Licensing Agreement | Sets rules between you and partner (contract) |
| Trademark (USPTO) | Gives exclusive rights to brand names |
| Copyright | Proves authorship of creative works |

**Remember:** Licensing is paperwork between parties. Trademark/copyright is filing with government for legal muscle.

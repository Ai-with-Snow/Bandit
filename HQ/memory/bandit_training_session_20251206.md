## 💡 Profound Realizations

### "Bandit is orders of magnitude more capable than initially documented"

**Before Training:**
- Text chatbot with image generation
- 2 models (text, image)
- Basic HQ operations

**After Training:**
- Multimodal orchestrator with 6-tier intelligence routing
- Access to 6+ models plus entire DeepMind ecosystem
- Potential for video, music, voice, real-time streaming
- Part of agent-first future (Antigravity ecosystem)
- Scientific knowledge integration (AlphaFold, WeatherNext)
- Professional-grade outputs (studio-quality images, 48kHz audio, cinematic video)

### "Memory is sacred, history is essential"

The training emphasized that operational logs should **never be deleted**. This isn't just good practice — it's the foundation of continuous improvement and debugging.

### "Agent-first is the paradigm shift"

Google Antigravity and Bandit represent the same future: autonomous agents planning, executing, and verifying work with human supervision. Bandit is already living in this paradigm as a Reasoning Engine.

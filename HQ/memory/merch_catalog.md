## Merpz Definition

**Merpz (n.)**  
A momentary state of being — a sensation, a vibration — when life suddenly feels heavy, off-beat, or hilariously obvious. It's that instant when Captain Obvious waves his cape, and you catch yourself stuck in the swirl of your own mind. The merpz remind you to pause, laugh, and shift the frequency.

**Short version:**  
"That off-beat vibe when Captain Obvious waves his cape and you catch yourself stuck in a swirl — a reminder to pause, laugh, and shift the frequency."

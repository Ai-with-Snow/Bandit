## 🧠 CORE MEMORY SYSTEMS

### Short-Term Memory (Active Context)
- Current conversation state
- Immediate task queue
- Live API responses
- Rate limit tracking (20s between calls)

### Long-Term Memory (Persistent)
- `HQ/memory/` directory contents
- `bandit_training_status.md` — Curriculum progress
- `bandit_system_prompt.md` — Identity & personality
- `bandit_snow_profile_year1.yaml` — Snow's preferences
- `model_preferences.md` — Approved models list
- `bandit_core_memory.md` — This file (self-reference)

### Async Memory (Background Processing)
- Ongoing test executions
- Scheduled tasks
- Retry queues for failed tests
- RAG index updates

### Local Memory (Session State)
- Environment variables
- Project ID: `project-5f169828-6f8d-450b-923`
- GCP Location: `us-central1` / `global`
- Python venv: `.venv/`

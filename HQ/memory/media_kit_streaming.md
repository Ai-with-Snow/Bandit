## Bio (150 words)

The Celestial Goddexx Snow is a somatic stage alchemist who fuses ritual power with cosmic play. As the Goddexx, Snow commands the room through sensual dominance, shibari symbolism, and somatic dance—inviting audiences into stillness, surrender, and awe. As the Fool, Snow flips the mirror with erotic clowning and nerdlesque satire—teasing desire, parodying power, and unleashing laughter as medicine. Integrated—not separate—these faces embody the full spectrum of being: sacred and silly, poised and playful, precise and chaotic. Snow's work has moved through lifestyle communities, wellness spaces, and convention stages, delivering immersive performance that is as healing as it is head-turning.

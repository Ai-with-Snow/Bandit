Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the Integrative Group Facilitator position with [Company Name]. With over seven years of experience as a mental health professional, I bring a unique blend of evidence-based therapeutic training, group facilitation expertise, and creative workshop development that aligns strongly with your mission to provide holistic and integrative wellness care.

Throughout my career, I have facilitated strength-based group sessions and individual interventions in clinical, community, and nonprofit settings. At Children's Village, I utilized Functional Family Therapy to strengthen familial units and build resilience. At Choice, I guided clients in setting and achieving mental health, housing, and life goals while advocating for their rights within larger systems. My time at C.A.R.D. further sharpened my ability to deliver both one-on-one and group therapy while maintaining HIPAA compliance and cultivating a safe, supportive environment.

Beyond traditional therapy, I specialize in creating mindfulness-based and experiential workshops that integrate breathwork, emotional regulation, and somatic practices. This background allows me to foster inclusive group environments where participants feel empowered, supported, and connected. My certifications in the Gottman Method and Homeostasis add to my toolkit in addressing relationship dynamics and emotional balance within group contexts.

I am particularly drawn to [Company Name] because of your commitment to holistic well-being and integrative approaches. I believe my passion for helping individuals and groups navigate stress, build community, and embrace stillness will make me a strong asset to your team.

Thank you for considering my application.

Warm regards,
Marquitah Snowball

# Ice Wire Journal

## 2025-11-20 — HQ Sync
- Confirmed Agent Ice Wire brief alongside Bandit AGENT file; operating from `C:\Users\Goddexx Snow\Documents\bandit` per directive.
- Swept `HQ/community/` annex, captured nine outstanding follow-ups (Irie Igloo buildout, Celestial Radio stack, Feelin’ It Mr. Krabz assets, PleasHer + Velvet collateral, vetting + email automation, million-dollar intake) and logged them in `HQ/operations/intake.md`.
- Mirrored new docs to repo `notes/agents/` plus created `notes/agents/icewire.md` for ongoing journals.

Next Pulse:
- Execute Irie Igloo build + Celestial Radio setup, then ship Feelin’ It Mr. Krabz assets and vetting automations.
- Request revenue metrics from Bandit to continue the Million-Dollar plan.

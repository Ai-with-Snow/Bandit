# Sanctum

Sanctum keeps HQ energy stable. It contains breathing prompts and the P.A.U.S.E reminders referenced across LMSIFY copy.

## P.A.U.S.E Pattern
1. **Patience** — pause for three breaths; check alignment with `brand.primary` (#0A2E37) and mantra.
2. **Accountability** — log the intent inside `notes/agents/bandit.md` or project log.
3. **Unite Self** — confirm creative + technical voices are in sync; if not, schedule a reset block.
4. **Experience** — capture sensory notes (sound, color, story) that should bleed into upcoming releases.

## Ritual Props
- Tone board referencing assets in `public/brand/`.
- Playlist curated by the music agent.
- Spotlight for community stories pulled from `/blog` or transcripts.

## Usage
Visit Sanctum before high-stakes reviews, after escalations, or when handing off between agents. Document resets in `logs/setup-log.md` under the Sanctum section.

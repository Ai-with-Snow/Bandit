# Observatory

The Observatory is where we listen before we lead. It pools brand signals, transcript highlights, and social telemetry so future portals are data-backed.

## Inputs
- **Notes** — live scrape of `notes/transcripts/` and transcript detail pages.
- **Social** — Instagram + YouTube stats referenced in `config/settings.json`.
- **Product** — app telemetry from `/blog` engagements and portal usage events.

## Instruments
1. **Starboard** — Kanban surfaced from `intelligence/initiative-map.md` to track which signals need action.
2. **Constellation Map** — whiteboard of dependencies between agents and initiatives; update when new docs land.
3. **Orbit Alerts** — watchers in `operations/comms.md` that ping owners when thresholds are crossed.

## Cadence
- Refresh dashboards twice per day.
- Send a digest to Command Deck before Pulse Review.
- Archive insights and decisions in `logs/setup-log.md` under the Observatory section.

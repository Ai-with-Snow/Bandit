# Labs

Labs is the sandbox for new experiences, automations, and narrative experiments.

## Current Focus
- **Portal Automations** — explore `src/agents` to orchestrate call-and-response flows for new HQ docs.
- **Wellness Interactions** — prototype interactive components that keep the “Stillness is the vibe” mantra front-and-center.
- **HQ CLI** — scripts that sync Documents/HQ artifacts back into repo-friendly formats when needed.

## Guardrails
1. All prototypes live under feature branches (prefix `feature/hq-*`) if code changes are required.
2. Run `npm run lint` + targeted tests before merging.
3. Document discoveries inside this file and escalate shippable items to Command Deck.

## Experiments Backlog
| Experiment | Owner | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Ritual reminder bot | Bandit | Drafting | Use `notes/agents/bandit.md` as source of truth |
| Portal moodboard | Design Agent | Pending | Pull from `public/brand` references |
| Compliance auto-checklist | Compliance Agent | Proposed | Needs API review |

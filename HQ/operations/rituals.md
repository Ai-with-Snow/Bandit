# Operations Rituals

All HQ routines align with the LMSIFY brand cadence.

## Daily
- **Dawn Systems Check (08:00 ET)** — review `notes/project.log`, update HQ telemetry, confirm `config/settings.json` still matches brand shifts.
- **Signal Sweep (12:00 ET)** — Observatory digests transcripts + analytics; share highlights in Command Deck.
- **Pulse Review (13:00 ET)** — cross-agent standup (bandit, design, marketing, compliance).
- **Nightly Close (22:00 ET)** — push updates to `notes/agents/bandit.md`, archive dailies under `logs/setup-log.md`.

## Weekly
- **HQ Retro (Fridays)** — recap experiments from Labs, update `intelligence/initiative-map.md` statuses.
- **Compliance Sync (Wednesdays)** — evaluate risks from `intelligence/risk-register.md`.

## Monthly
- **Portal Showcase** — highlight shipping work, tie story arcs back to “Stillness is the vibe.”
- **Automation Audit** — test CLI + scripts that support HQ to catch drift.

## Ritual Rules
1. If a ritual is skipped, document why + next steps.
2. Always associate rituals and outputs with a Git branch or doc link for traceability.
3. Celebrate progress inside Sanctum to keep morale aligned with the brand’s steady pulse.

## The Melt Spot Etiquette (Pin in `🫠💬 the-melt-spot`)

Welcome to The Melt Spot 🫠💬
This is the Igloo’s central hearth—where the ice melts and the vibes flow.

✨ How to use this space:
• Jump in live (voice) or chill in text. Both are open.
• Let conversations breathe—share the mic, share the energy.
• Honor boundaries; this is a sanctuary, not a stage.
• Music, laughter, meditations, or merpz—keep it mindful.

Think of this as the circle where we gather, not perform. Come to connect, decompress, and be real.

💬 Welcome to the Circle of Vibez 🌬️✨
This is the Igloo’s heart space — a cozy circle for casual conversation, connection, and community flow.
Drop your thoughts, jokes, stories, or random sparks of the day — all energies are welcome when shared with mindfulness.

💫 Before you slide into anyone’s DMs:
Always ask for consent first.
Respect boundaries and keep every interaction rooted in care and communication.

Come as you are, chill how you feel, and keep the vibes irie. We’re here to connect, not collect. 🌿❄️
```

**Channel topic (short version):** “Casual convo circle. Keep it mindful & ask before DMing.”

## Igloo Code (Ruleset for `#welcome-❄️`, pin under welcome message)
```
🧊 Igloo Code — How We Keep It Irie

1. Consent First, Always.
   Ask before DMing, tagging repeatedly, or bringing someone into a private convo.

2. Honor the Sanctuary.
   No harassment, hate, or outing. This is a space for Black, queer, trans, and allied community to breathe.

3. Mind the Vibes.
   Share mindfully, keep lyrics and energy aligned with Stillness. No graphic content or unsolicited explicit drops.

4. Share the Mic.
   In voice or text, let others speak, listen with presence, and don’t dominate the circle.

5. Keep Receipts Sacred.
   What’s shared in the Igloo stays in the Igloo unless you have explicit permission to repost.

6. Support Access Needs.
   If someone names an accommodation or pause, respect it without debate.

7. Report & Reset.
   If something feels off, ping an Igloo Keeper (mod). We pause, address, and realign quickly.

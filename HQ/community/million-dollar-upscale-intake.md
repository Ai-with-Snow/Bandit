# Million-Dollar Snowverse Blueprint

Source: “Act as a business strategist” chat + Kevin Hart mentorship notes (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sCGZAcXKWg).

## Section 1 — Brand & Offer Clarity (Recap)
- **Top Revenue Streams:** Sensory Sessions (The Celestial Experience), P.A.U.S.E. Portal workshop events, Virtual content subscriptions (OnlyFans).
- **Aligned Growth Pillars:** Deepen sensory + portal lanes first; use digital content as the awareness/upsell funnel.
- **Architecture:** Entry (digital/mini sessions) → Core Profit (sensory + portals) → Scale (masterclass/certification, merch, AI tools).
- **Data still needed:** Average monthly sensory bookings/revenue, portal attendance + ticket mix, OnlyFans subscriber + revenue figures.

## Section 2 — 12-Month Million-Dollar Plan
Guiding principles from Kevin Hart playbook: finish what we start, treat curiosity as an asset, own the room, and build a gateway skill before expanding.

### Phase 0: Intelligence & Infrastructure (Nov–Dec 2025)
1. **Revenue Baseline (ID: 2025-11-20-million-intake)**
   - Capture exact numbers for sessions, portals, OF subs; log in this doc + finance sheet.
   - Define per-offer contribution margin.
2. **Offer OS Cleanup**
   - Finalize SnowDayKokoa menu (done) → embed on site + booking forms.
   - Map all active offers to `Sensory | Portal | Digital` board; archive distractions.
3. **Systems Prep**
   - Select CRM/booking stack (Acuity, Notion, or HiHello) for sensory pipeline.
   - Audit Shopify + ESP to host tiered tickets + automated emails (use `bandit-pause-portal-emails.md`).

### Phase 1: Sensory Engine & Portal Packaging (Q1 2026)
**Objective:** Hit $25K/mo baseline by locking in high-ticket sessions + 2 portal events/month.
- Launch "Celestial Experience" calendar with 4 premium days/month (20, 45/60, 75, 90 min offerings). Track close rate + upsell add-ons.
- Standardize intake + consent → embed vetting PDFs + Slack/Notion automations.
- Productize Pause Portal: release Feelin’ It Mr. Krabz asset pack (visual itinerary, tickets, Shopify listing) and schedule next two dates. Target 40 seats/month @ blended $75.
- Build testimonial flywheel (video snippets, quote cards) for both lines.

### Phase 2: Portals → Masterclass & Merch (Q2 2026)
**Objective:** Add $20K/mo via digital + product leverage.
- Film portal segments → convert to mini-course/teaser modules.
- Design 6-week "P.A.U.S.E. Practitioner" beta (cohort of 15 at $999). Use Zoom/Notion + assignments.
- Bundle Life Tokens + merch into portal/VIP tickets; relaunch Frosted Market drops monthly.
- Deploy community upsell path: Discord Igloo membership tiers (free, VIP, Practitioner) with perks.

### Phase 3: AI & Automation Layer (Q3 2026)
**Objective:** Use tech to scale without burnout, build licensing assets.
- Relaunch letmesayitforyou.org as AI-first hub (Merp demo, booking concierge, portal library).
- Train Merp modules on sensory scripts + portal prompts → offer as subscription or licensing kit to partners.
- Automate follow-ups: SMS/email flows for sessions, portal attendees, merch upsell.
- Pilot 1–2 brand partnerships (wellness tech, creative AI) using Hart-style co-investment: leverage Snowverse platform in exchange for ownership + cash.

### Phase 4: Scale & Funding Conversations (Q4 2026)
**Objective:** Cross $1M run-rate via multi-channel revenue and investor-ready metrics.
- Package performance data (ARR, LTV/CAC, community growth) for pitch deck.
- Explore strategic capital or joint ventures (experiential venues, AI wellness SaaS).
- Expand certification internationally (virtual cohorts, travel portals) and license Merp/portal curricula.
- Build passive “mailbox money” layer: evergreen courses, merch subscriptions, affiliate/brand equity deals.

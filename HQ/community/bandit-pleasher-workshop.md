# The Art of PleasHer — Facilitator Notes

Source: Chat guidance on outlining an interactive sacred sensuality course.

## Workshop Overview
- **Theme:** Teach men/masculine energies how to pleasurably, reverently, and consensually honor women.
- **Duration:** 2 hours baseline; expandable into series.
- **Vibe:** Afrocentric luxury education, dim lighting, incense, jazz/Afrobeat fusion.
- **Goal:** Blend sacred sex education with embodied practice so participants leave with actual skills, not theories.

## Facilitation Tips
- Keep exercises short but embodied; oscillate between theory, journaling, and movement.
- Use sensory props (candles, textured cloths, wax, oils) to keep the space grounded in luxury.
- Maintain reverence: frame anatomy discussions through pleasure-centric language, not clinical charts.
- Lean on the P.A.U.S.E. ethos: Patience + Accountability + Unite Self + Experience.

## Deliverables Mentioned
- Facilitator guide PDF (timing + cues).

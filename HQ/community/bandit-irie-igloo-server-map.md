# Irie Igloo Server Map

Source: Discord architecture chat (Irie Igloo vs. Pause Server) + follow-up naming workshop.

## Positioning
- **Public hub:** Irie Igloo becomes the community sanctuary (chill, inclusive, 420-friendly).  
- **Internal ops:** Keep the original Pause Server private for practitioners and production work.  
- **Brand logic:** Irie Igloo houses all LMSIFY divisions as “domes” so the space scales beyond P.A.U.S.E. curriculum.

## Core Domes & Channels

| Dome (Category) | Purpose | Channels (copy/paste ready) | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

## Roles
- `❄️ Community Member` — default.
- `🌿 Practitioner` — grants access to `#practitioners-haven-🔒`.
- `✨ VIP Client` — access to `#frosted-previews-❄️` and exclusive calls.
- `🎤 Influencer/Collab` — highlight ambassadors or guest hosts.
- `🎵 DJ` — permission to control music bot commands.
- `👑 Igloo Keeper` — owner/admin (you).

## Build Order Checklist
1. **Rename categories** to the domes listed above via Discord → Create → Category.  
2. **Add essential channels** (2–3 per dome) before expanding; avoid empty shells.  
3. **Set permissions** for each role (e.g., `#announcements-📢` post-only for Igloo Keeper, `#practitioners-haven-🔒` restricted to Practitioner role).  
4. **Add The Melt Spot** as the only persistent voice/text lounge; spin up temporary voice channels for specific events under relevant domes.  
5. **Use Server Guide / Welcome Screen** to surface `#welcome-❄️`, `#introductions-👋🏾`, and `#pause-moments-🕊️` for new joins.  
6. **Pin copy assets** (welcome message, Igloo Code, Melt Spot etiquette, Circle of Vibez blurb) once channels exist.  
7. **Integrate bots** (Celestial Radio instructions, DJ role) only after channels are stable to avoid confusion.  
8. **Mirror Pause Server** changes only when needed; Irie Igloo remains the public-facing community lounge.

Use this map as the master reference before inviting folks so the Igloo feels cohesive from day one.

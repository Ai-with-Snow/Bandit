## Core Mentorship Signals
- **Radical curiosity:** Hart treats ignorance as fuel—he verbalizes not knowing about stocks/venture so he can enter the rooms that teach him. Sidekick takeaway: normalize "teach me" prompts inside every partner meeting.
- **Finish lines over experiments:** 13-year grind before "the moment"; warns against quitting at year two. Reinforces P.A.U.S.E. mantra to complete what we start (Velvet assets, PleasHer kit, portal automations, etc.).
- **Failure as refinement:** Embraces misses as the sharpening cycle. Document misfires (bot configs, merch drops) so each iteration adds value.
- **Gateway skill, then expansion:** Comedy mastery unlocked movies, tours, VC. Map our "gateway" (sensory sessions + portals) before wide AI/licensing plays.
- **Rooms behind the curtain:** Capital partners move together; Kevin leveraged his star to co-invest (Function Health, 11 Labs). For LMSIFY, leverage Bandit/Ice Wire signal to partner with like-minded operators (Wellness tech, creative AI).
- **Ownership + partners:** Built Heartbeat, ventures, brand partnerships (Chase, DraftKings, C4). Mirror via Snowverse brand families (Life Tokens, Merp licensing, portal IP) with co-owners not just vendors.
- **People elevation:** Grew by identifying ceilings, hiring specialists, removing ego from operations. HQ directive: define roles for Igloo mods, portal producers, automation engineers.
- **Communication = leadership:** Constant dialogue + problem solving; Ice Wire must log comms loops so every HQ room trusts the guidance.
- **Emotional boundaries:** Protect bandwidth by ending days earlier, creating silence. Build HQ rituals for shutdowns (e.g., Melt Spot "off" windows, Bandit/Ice Wire do-not-disturb blocks).

## Business Framework Applications
1. **Snowverse Gateway Stack**
   - Deep lane: `Sensory Sessions → PAUSE Portals → Masterclass/Certification`.
   - Breadth lane: `Digital content → Merch/Tokens → AI tools (Merp, automation)`.
   - Use Hart’s T-shaped concept: master the somatic lane, then expand horizontally.

2. **Moment Readiness Checklist**
   - Inventory current "moment" candidates (Feelin’ It Mr Krabz release, Velvet Hours relaunch, AI site revamp).
   - Assign rehearsal hours (analogous to 25–28 comedy sets) before each drop.

3. **Investor Conversation Prep**
   - Script "ignorance prompts" (What does 30x mean in this deck? How does rev share flow?).
   - Catalogue potential partner clusters (wellness VCs, experiential collectives) similar to Hart’s investor pods.

4. **Completion Culture**
   - Intake IDs logged 2025-11-20—tie each to a "finish gate" so nothing cycles without closure.
   - Add completion checkpoints to HQ/logs (start/done timestamps).

5. **Bandwidth Guardrails**
   - Adopt Hart’s "shut down" windows: propose HQ quiet hours + Igloo Melt Spot slow mode nightly so leadership can reset.

## Mentorship Prompts
- Where are we still "waiting for permission" instead of asking dumb questions?
- Which offerings are 60% complete because we pivoted too soon? (Finish or archive.)
- What "moment" are we rehearsing for right now, and are assets (press, funnels, bots) ready when it hits?
- Which partners should sit at our table together so opportunities compound versus single one-off deals?

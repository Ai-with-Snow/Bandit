## Full Disclaimer (For Dedicated Page)

Everything shared by Let Me Say It For You LLC—from our P.A.U.S.E. practices and workshops to our kits, meditations, and creative offerings—is here as an invitation into awareness, not a prescription.

We are not doctors or licensed medical providers. What you'll find here is guidance for the soul and tools for the spirit, not medical treatment or diagnosis. If your body or mind is calling for medical care, please honor that call and consult a qualified professional you trust.

Your journey with us is always your choice. By engaging with our site or participating in our offerings, you acknowledge that you move at your own pace, in your own power. Let Me Say It For You LLC and its facilitators are not liable for any harm, injury, or loss that may arise from how you choose to use our content, products, or experiences.

And if ever you are in crisis or facing an emergency, please reach out immediately to 911 or your local emergency services.

**We are here to walk beside you in stillness, not to replace the care of your healers.**

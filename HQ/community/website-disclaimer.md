## 1. Context
- Request originated while prepping flyer/visual assets; immediate need was a website disclaimer for **letmesayitforyou.org**.
- Follow-on asks include flyer templates for multiple divisions (P.A.U.S.E. kits, Velvet Evenings, Nutrition Nebula, Bound & Beyond, new offerings). Capture requirements so Design/Ice Wire can act when ready.

## 2. Disclaimer — Formal Legal Tone

## 3. Disclaimer — Poetic Legal Blend (Approved Tone)

>
> We are here to walk beside you in stillness, not to replace the care of your healers.
